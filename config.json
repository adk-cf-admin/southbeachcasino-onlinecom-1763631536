Public sources confirm slot denominations from 1 cent to $5 per credit; table games typically start at $5 and scale up depending on the table and day\/time (evenings\/weekends often run higher limits). Actual limits can vary on the floor.\n<\/p><br>\n<p> \nAccuracy note: Slot denominations (1\u00a2\u2013$5) are stated on the official site; table-game minimums \u201ctypically $5+\u201d come from an industry review. For any specific table\/time, check the limit placard or ask the pit boss.\n<\/p><br>\n\n\n\n<table style=\"width:100%; border-collapse:collapse; margin-top:16px;\">\n            <thead>\n                <tr style=\"background:#F26724; color:#fff;\">\n                    <th style=\"border:2px solid #ccc; padding:8px; text-align:left;\">Game Type<\/th>\n                    <th style=\"border:2px solid #ccc; padding:8px; text-align:center;\">Minimum Bet<\/th>\n                    <th style=\"border:2px solid #ccc; padding:8px; text-align:center;\">Maximum Bet<\/th>\n                <\/tr>\n            <\/thead>\n            <tbody>\n                <tr>\n                    <td style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; padding:8px;\">Slot Machines<\/td>\n                    <td style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; padding:8px; text-align:center;\">$0.01 <\/td>\n                    <td style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; padding:8px; text-align:center;\">$5 <\/td>\n                <\/tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; padding:8px;\">Electronic tables <\/td>\n                    <td style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; padding:8px; text-align:center;\">$1\u2013$2 <\/td>\n                    <td style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; padding:8px; text-align:center;\"> $25+<\/td>\n                <\/tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; padding:8px;\">Blackjack (Live)<\/td>\n                    <td style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; padding:8px; text-align:center;\">$5 <\/td>\n                    <td style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; padding:8px; text-align:center;\">$100+<\/td>\n                <\/tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; padding:8px;\">Roulette(live)<\/td>\n                    <td style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; padding:8px; text-align:center;\">$5 outside <\/td>\n                    <td style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; padding:8px; text-align:center;\"> $100+ <\/td>\n                <\/tr>\n                <tr>\n                    <td style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; padding:8px;\">Texas Shootout (table)<\/td>\n                    <td style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; padding:8px; text-align:center;\">$5<\/td>\n                    <td style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; padding:8px; text-align:center;\">$100+<\/td>\n                <\/tr>\n          <tr>\n                    <td style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; padding:8px;\">High Card Flush (table)<\/td>\n                    <td style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; padding:8px; text-align:center;\">$5<\/td>\n                    <td style=\"border:1px solid #ccc; padding:8px; text-align:center;\">$100+<\/td>\n                <\/tr>\n            <\/tbody>\n        <\/table><br>\n<h4 style = \"font-weight: bold; font-size: 24px;\">Limit Notes<\/h4>\n\n\n        <ul>\n            <li>\u2022 \nSlots (IGT, Aristocrat, etc.): Actual spin cost = denom \u00d7 lines\/credits; progressives may require max credit for jackpot\n<\/li>\n            <li>\u2022 \nElectronic tables (roulette, etc.): Limit depends on terminal configuration; shown on the device\n<\/li>\n            <li>\u2022 \nBlackjack (live): Evening\/weekend tables often run higher; dedicated high-limit options\n<\/li>\n            <li>\u2022 \nRoulette (live): Inside bets may have different minimums; see table placard\n<\/li>\n\t    <li>\u2022 \nTexas Shootout (table): Poker-based house game; limits vary by shift\n<\/li>\n\t    <li>\u2022 \nHigh Card Flush (table): Ante\/bonus bets have separate limits; confirm with dealer\n<\/li>\n        <\/ul><br>\n\n<h3 style = \"font-weight: bold;font-size: 32px;\">\nEvents and Entertainment at South Beach Casino & Resort\n<\/h3>\n\n<p> \nSouth Beach Casino & Resort is not just about gaming\u2014it\u2019s a hub for vibrant events and entertainment.
